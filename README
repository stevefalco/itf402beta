This is an interpreter for Infocom games.  This version is intended for use
on a PDP-11 running 2.11BSD, but it can be compiled for other enviroments too.

Compile it via "make bsd_ansi".

Note that it expects you to use ^H to backspace over typos.

I've only played Zork1 with it so far, but it appears to work fine, including
saving and restoring the game.
